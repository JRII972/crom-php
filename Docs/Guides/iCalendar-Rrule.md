The iCalendar format (RFC 5545) defines a standard for specifying recurring events using the `RRULE` (Recurrence Rule) property. Below, I'll provide a comprehensive JSON model that includes all possible options for an iCalendar `RRULE`, based on the specification. Each component of the `RRULE` will be represented with its purpose and possible values, along with explanations. This model will serve as a template for constructing any recurrence rule.

### iCalendar RRULE Overview
The `RRULE` property defines a rule for repeating events, tasks, or other calendar components. It consists of several components, such as `FREQ`, `INTERVAL`, `BYDAY`, `BYMONTH`, etc., which together specify the pattern of repetition. The general syntax is:

```
RRULE:FREQ=frequency;INTERVAL=n;UNTIL=date;BYDAY=days;...
```

### JSON Model for All RRULE Options
Below is a JSON model that includes all possible `RRULE` components as defined in the iCalendar specification (RFC 5545). Each field is optional unless specified, and the model includes descriptions of allowed values.

### Explanation of RRULE Components
Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of each component, as included in the JSON model:

1. **FREQ** (Required):
   - Specifies the frequency of recurrence.
   - Allowed values: `SECONDLY`, `MINUTELY`, `HOURLY`, `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY`, `YEARLY`.
   - Example: `FREQ=WEEKLY` means the event repeats every week.

2. **INTERVAL**:
   - Specifies the interval between recurrences.
   - Default is `1` (e.g., every week). A value of `2` means every other week.
   - Example: `FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2` means every other week.

3. **UNTIL**:
   - Specifies the end date/time for the recurrence in iCalendar DATE-TIME format (e.g., `20251231T235959Z` for UTC or `20251231` for date-only).
   - Mutually exclusive with `COUNT`.
   - Example: `FREQ=WEEKLY;UNTIL=20251231` means repeat weekly until December 31, 2025.

4. **COUNT**:
   - Specifies the number of occurrences before stopping.
   - Mutually exclusive with `UNTIL`.
   - Example: `FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=10` means repeat daily for 10 occurrences.

5. **BYSECOND**:
   - Specifies seconds within a minute for `SECONDLY` frequency.
   - Range: `0` to `60` (includes leap seconds).
   - Example: `FREQ=SECONDLY;BYSECOND=0,30` means every 0th and 30th second of a minute.

6. **BYMINUTE**:
   - Specifies minutes within an hour for `MINUTELY` or higher frequencies.
   - Range: `0` to `59`.
   - Example: `FREQ=MINUTELY;BYMINUTE=0,15,30,45` means every 15 minutes.

7. **BYHOUR**:
   - Specifies hours within a day for `HOURLY` or higher frequencies.
   - Range: `0` to `23`.
   - Example: `FREQ=HOURLY;BYHOUR=9,17` means at 9 AM and 5 PM daily.

8. **BYDAY**:
   - Specifies days of the week, optionally with an ordinal (e.g., `+1MO` for the first Monday, `-2TU` for the second-to-last Tuesday).
   - Days: `SU` (Sunday), `MO` (Monday), `TU` (Tuesday), `WE` (Wednesday), `TH` (Thursday), `FR` (Friday), `SA` (Saturday).
   - Example: `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR` means every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

9. **BYMONTHDAY**:
   - Specifies days of the month (positive or negative).
   - Range: `1` to `31` (positive) or `-31` to `-1` (negative, e.g., `-1` for the last day).
   - Example: `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=1,15` means the 1st and 15th of each month.

10. **BYYEARDAY**:
    - Specifies days of the year (positive or negative).
    - Range: `1` to `366` (positive) or `-366` to `-1` (negative).
    - Not valid for `MONTHLY` or `WEEKLY` frequencies.
    - Example: `FREQ=YEARLY;BYYEARDAY=1,100` means the 1st and 100th days of the year.

11. **BYWEEKNO**:
    - Specifies weeks of the year (positive or negative).
    - Range: `1` to `53` (positive) or `-53` to `-1` (negative).
    - Only valid for `YEARLY` frequency.
    - Example: `FREQ=YEARLY;BYWEEKNO=1,26` means the 1st and 26th weeks of the year.

12. **BYMONTH**:
    - Specifies months of the year.
    - Range: `1` to `12`.
    - Example: `FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1,7` means January and July each year.

13. **BYSETPOS**:
    - Filters the set of dates generated by other `BY` rules, selecting specific positions (e.g., `1` for the first, `-1` for the last).
    - Range: `-366` to `-1` and `1` to `366`.
    - Example: `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO;BYSETPOS=1` means the first Monday of each month.

14. **WKST**:
    - Specifies the day on which the week starts.
    - Allowed values: `SU`, `MO`, `TU`, `WE`, `TH`, `FR`, `SA`.
    - Default: `MO` (Monday).
    - Example: `FREQ=WEEKLY;WKST=SU` means the week starts on Sunday.

### Example Usage
To represent your original rule `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO` using this model, you would use:

```json
{
  "rrule": {
    "FREQ": {
      "value": "WEEKLY"
    },
    "BYDAY": {
      "value": ["MO"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Notes
- **Mutual Exclusivity**: `UNTIL` and `COUNT` cannot be used together.
- **Constraints**: Some components (e.g., `BYYEARDAY`, `BYWEEKNO`) have restrictions based on `FREQ`.
- **Default Values**: Fields like `INTERVAL` default to `1`, and `WKST` defaults to `MO`.
- **Date Format**: `UNTIL` uses iCalendar DATE-TIME (e.g., `20251231T235959Z`) or DATE (e.g., `20251231`) format.
- **BYDAY Ordinals**: The `BYDAY` field can include ordinals (e.g., `+1MO`, `-2TU`) for specific occurrences in a month or year.

### How to Use the Model
- **Create a Rule**: Select the desired components from the JSON model and populate their `value` fields.
- **Validation**: Ensure that the values conform to the specified ranges and constraints (e.g., `BYWEEKNO` only for `YEARLY`).
- **Implementation**: Use this JSON structure to generate an `RRULE` string or to parse an existing one in your application.

If you need a specific `RRULE` example generated with this model or assistance implementing it in a programming context (e.g., PHP with your Docker setup), let me know!
